# Is Yerba? (v1.0)
This project is an image processing tool that can determine whether an object you show to the webcam is a 
[Guayak√≠ Yerba Mate](https://guayaki.com/shop/) or not. The inspiration for this project came from Silicon Valley's 
[Jian Yang's SeeFood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACmydtFDTGs) project when he only could determine whether an 
item was either a hot dog or not. This project was built within 12 hours during CU Boulder's Local Hack Day 2019 event 
on Saturday, December 7th. Since Yerba Mate was abundantly available at this event, I thought why not try something funny?

## Getting started
Since this website has not been deployed online yet, you will need to download the files locally. To do this, download
isyerba.zip from the main page and save it in an accessible location. Once that is finished, unzip the folder and open 
index.html inside of your favorite browser. 

Once the website is open, go ahead and click on, 'SCAN YOUR IMAGE BELOW BY CLICKING HERE'. A window should open saying
~~~
file:/// wants to use your camera
~~~

Once you select allow, the browser should open your webcam and you're good to go! The numerical values below the webcam
screen will identify whether the object in your webcam is a Yerba Mate or not.
